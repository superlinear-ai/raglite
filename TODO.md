1. Fix query adapter (weight the rows by the gap I want to close)
2. Extract evals and complete evaluation
3. [x] Make RAG robust against context size, update the config if needed
4. Markdown conversion based on bbox size instead of font size (more robust)
5. Testing for query adapter
6. Get document & page metadata for RAG sources -- how?
7. Make query adapter usage a config variable?

Longer term:
8. Add support for Postgres?
9.  Add support for OpenAI client?
10. Data connectors
11. Deployable?
