# RAGLite

A RAG extension for SQLite.

‚ö†Ô∏è This project is a work in progress!

## Installing

To install this package, run:

```sh
pip install raglite
```

## Features

1. ‚ù§Ô∏è Only lightweight and permissive open source dependencies
2. üõ°Ô∏è Fully local RAG with [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) as an LLM provider and [SQLite](https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite) as a local database
3. ‚úçÔ∏è Automatic conversion of any input document to Markdown
4. ‚úÇÔ∏è Optimal Markdown-aware [level 4 semantic chunking](https://medium.com/@anuragmishra_27746/five-levels-of-chunking-strategies-in-rag-notes-from-gregs-video-7b735895694d)
5. üåà [Multiple vector chunk retrieval](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/multi_vector/)
6. üîç [Hybrid search](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf) that combines [SQLite's BM25 full-text search](https://sqlite.org/fts5.html) with [PyNNDescent's ANN vector search](https://github.com/lmcinnes/pynndescent)

## Using

Example usage:

```python
# Index:
from pathlib import Path
from raglite.document_indexer import insert_document, update_index

doc_path = Path("intelligence.pdf")
insert_document(doc_path)
update_index()

# Search:
from raglite.search import keyword_search, vector_search, hybrid_search, fusion_search

prompt = "How is intelligence measured?"
results_vector = vector_search(prompt, num_results=5)
results_bm25 = keyword_search(prompt, num_results=5)
results_hybrid = hybrid_search(prompt, num_results=5)
results_fusion = fusion_search(prompt, num_results=5)

# RAG:
from raglite.rag import rag

prompt = "What is a 'SkillProgram'?"
stream = rag(prompt, search=hybrid_search)
for update in stream:
    print(update, end="")
```
